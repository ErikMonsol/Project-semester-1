Simple Overview: Community Science Museum Website Project
Objective: Develop a responsive, engaging website for the Community Science Museum, targeting middle school pupils (ages 7-15) and families.

## Description

In this project, I am tasked with developing a website for the Community Science Museum, which targets middle school children and families with young children. My goal is to create a website that is both informative and engaging, designed to appeal to the curiosity and intelligence of young minds, encouraging them and their families to visit the museum.

My responsibilities include effectively using provided media assets in my design, paying close attention to the target audience's preferences in layout, color schemes, and typography. The website will consist of 4-6 pages, and I will ensure it is optimized for fast loading, with images not exceeding 200kb, and is accessible in compliance with WCAG standards.

This project requires me to demonstrate a high level of technical proficiency in HTML and CSS. I will focus on creating semantically structured HTML and CSS that adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Additionally, the website must be responsive, providing a smooth user experience across various devices.

For the submission, I will provide a live version of the site, a prototype, a link to my GitHub repository containing the project code, and a comprehensive report. This report will discuss the design and technical aspects of my project, my adherence to WCAG guidelines, SEO management, and content handling. I am aware that the project duration is set at four weeks for full-time students and eight weeks for part-time students.
